The dataset is called elliptic bitcoin dataset at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ellipticco/elliptic-data-set. The goal of my dataset is to accurately build a model which can classify whether a bitcoin user id is fraud or not. All the python files show each iteration that was run with the parameters adjusted. I used Python 3.8.5 to run all these files; new versions of Python will not be able to import the required packages needed. Also I read and saved the data using the absolute path, so the paths will need to be changed depending on what kind of machine you are running it on.

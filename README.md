The dataset is called elliptic bitcoin dataset at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ellipticco/elliptic-data-set. The goal of my dataset is to accurately build a model which can classify whether a bitcoin user id is fraud or not. All the python files show each iteration that was run with the parameters adjusted, with the exception of the data cleaning file which creates the dataset used for my experiments. I used Python 3.9 to run all these files; new versions of Python will not be able to import the required packages needed. Also I read and saved the data using the absolute path, so the paths will need to be changed depending on what kind of machine you are running it on.

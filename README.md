The dataset is called elliptic bitcoin dataset at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ellipticco/elliptic-data-set. The goal of my dataset is to accurately build a model which can classify whether a bitcoin user id is fraud or not. All the python files show each iteration that was run with the parameters adjusted.
